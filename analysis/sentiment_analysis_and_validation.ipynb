These companies are lot like one that I previously worked for in which there is an in-group and an out-group. Sadly these groups are basically just formed dependent on individual personalities. For instance, one common personality trait would cause a person to view their job as nothing more than a means to support their family. There is nothing wrong with this trait and often these people are great workers because they have great motivations but they never work their way into the companies \"family\".\\n\\nThis in-group/out-group thing is most common in smaller start-up companies but can persist for a long time even as the company grows. The \"in-group\" varies in type from business to business. Sadly it functions somewhat in the same that high schools often do with the \"popular\" kids and other groups, though in these companies the \"popular\" kids are often the \"nerds\" as it was in the company I worked for.

During another, he noticed that an executive was missing and called him. The man’s wife had recently given birth, and he explained that he was taking time off as she recuperated. Musk was angry. At a minimum, you should be on phone calls, Musk told the man. Having a kid doesn’t prevent you from being on the phone. (A Tesla spokesperson said that while Musk “was once upset that a particular executive did not dial into an important conference call several days after his child was born,” the company would not penalize an employee for taking paternity leave.)\\n\\n-----------\\n\\n\\n&gt; The young Tesla engineer was excited. Ecstatic, in fact. It was a Saturday in October 2017, and he was working at the Gigafactory, Tesla’s enormous battery manufacturing plant in Nevada. Over the previous year, he had been living out of a suitcase, putting in 13-hour days, seven days a week. This was his first real job. And now a colleague had tracked him down to say that Elon Musk—Elon Musk!—needed his personal help.\\n\\n&gt; The previous year, Musk had made an audacious announcement: His company, which was known—fetishized, actually—for its luxurious electric vehicles, would soon begin manufacturing a new sedan that it planned to sell for just $35,000, putting it within reach of the middle class. The Model 3, Tesla hoped, would transform the auto industry by proving that a mass-produced, emissions-free vehicle was not only feasible but profitable. If successful, the vehicle would help end humanity’s addiction to fossil fuels, slow climate change, and show that ingenuity and ambition could accomplish nearly anything. Within a year of that announcement, however, work on the car was behind schedule. There were problems in battery manufacturing, parts construction, development of assembly lines. Tesla’s goal was to build 5,000 vehicles a week; recently the company had been producing roughly three cars a day. Many inside the Gigafactory—not to mention at the Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto and the assembly factory in Fremont, California—had been working hard for months, trying to get things on track.\\n\\n&gt; Musk was spending the weekend in the Gigafactory, attempting to discover why machines weren’t functioning, why parts kept misaligning, why the software was crashing. Musk had demanded that his factories be automated as much as possible. But among the consequences of this extreme roboticization were delays and malfunctions. Tesla had spent more than $1 billion building the Gigafactory, and almost nothing was going as planned.\\n\\n&gt; **At about 10 o’clock on Saturday evening, an angry Musk was examining one of the production line’s mechanized modules, trying to figure out what was wrong, when the young, excited engineer was brought over to assist him.**\\n\\n&gt; **“Hey, buddy, this doesn’t work!” Musk shouted at the engineer, according to someone who heard the conversation. “Did you do this?”**\\n\\n&gt; **The engineer was taken aback. He had never met Musk before. Musk didn’t even know the engineer’s name. The young man wasn’t certain what, exactly, Musk was asking him, or why he sounded so angry.**\\n\\n&gt; **“You mean, program the robot?” the engineer said. “Or design that tool?”**\\n\\n&gt; **“Did you fucking do this?” Musk asked him.**\\n\\n&gt; **“I’m not sure what you’re referring to?” the engineer replied apologetically.**\\n\\n&gt; **“You’re a fucking idiot!” Musk shouted back. “Get the fuck out and don’t come back!”**\\n\\n&gt; **The young engineer climbed over a low safety barrier and walked away. He was bewildered by what had just happened. The entire conversation had lasted less than a minute. A few moments later, his manager came over to say that he had been fired on Musk’s orders, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The engineer was shocked. He’d been working so hard. He was set to get a review from his manager the next week, and had been hearing only positive things. Instead, two days later, he signed his separation papers.**',\n",
