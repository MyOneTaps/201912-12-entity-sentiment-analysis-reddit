t3_cb1woe,1,0,0,"Well, think about your definition of ""bringing something to the world.""Sure, he didn't invent digital payments, the electric car, or rockets, nor did he design the initial systems of PayPal, Tesla, or SpaceX.  But he brought those systems to the world at large. It takes a massive amount of effort, ingenuity, and persistence in order to scale a unproven concept onto the world stage. It's not simply shouting at people until things get done. You have to have a specific vision for how this thing will fit into the world from coordinating design teams, manufacturing, mass distribution, local distribution, raising capital and managing it while you're not yet profitable, gaining the trust of customers, navigating complex regulations from outdated systems, coordinating with 3rd parties for necessary infrastructure, and so much more. It's so unfair to say that he doesn't bring that much to the world. What single person in your view brings more?"
t3_aw27st,1,1,0,I agree. I don't understand the downvotes here. The man is literally a modern day Tesla or Edison. Granted he doesn't really build the stuff himself. It's the ideas he carries.

t3_cb1woe,,,,"Your first point (Tesla); electric cars have always been the future, just because they were inevitable that doesnt make Tesla any less important. It could have been only a couple more years or decades before the next company did it, we dont know. But with Tesla we do know its happening right now and time does matter when it comes to changing a market like this for the better.Its also not a stretch at all to say self driving vehicles will save lives, thousands of lives. In the US alone there are 30,000 plus deaths per year on the road, computers are already better drivers than humans we just wont be comfortable with them until they're basically infallible. If they reduce road deaths by even 10% thats thousands of lives and thats a pretty conservative estimate. Again it would have happened eventually but the sooner the better. The Model 3 is also continually getting cheaper and like Ive said, theyre almost at 200,000+ sold so to say they havent sold that many is disingenuous. They started with the roadsters and model S which were truly for the rich and are now working their way to consumer levels. I like that progress. Second point (SpaceX); Yeah, for the time being resource acquistion is a stretch but it is inevitable which is why I mentioned it. Not just precious metals but just things like water to create fuel for deep space travel.Im not sure what you mean by controversy. SpaceX developed reusable rockets, a fairly simple concept just difficult to execute. Their cost to orbit is significantly lower than anyone else's, and only going to get lower.https://spacenews.com/spacexs-reusable-falcon-9-what-are-the-real-cost-savings-for-customers/Third (Starlink); It just started, no news that it works, no news that it doesnt. Theres nothing wrong with supporting the idea behind it and the fact that someone is making an earnest attempt. And even if its not free, it will make access much cheaper.Ill admit, I was only speaking of myself and those I know personally about why we think he is an important figure. From that perspective its because of the reasons above. I dont know anything about his social media. I dont stay up late waiting for his press conferences. He's an influential person changing the world for the better and inspiring (or economically forcing) related markets to do the same.As for his detractors, it seems their gripes are more an adverse reaction to the admitedly bloated, constant media attention he gets, not because he's hasnt contributed anything."

This has implications for the environment and the safety/efficiency of mass transport as self-driving cars are introduced saving thousands of lives a year.SpaceX: Cut the cost of transferring objects and materials to space tremendously via reusable launch vehicles improving the future of communications, scientific research, weather monitoring, and possibly resource acquisition.As a footnote to SpaceX, Starlink (already in the works) will provide interent access globally to places that desparately need improved access or any access at all while also cutting latency. This is possible because of the reduced cost of moving things to orbit.Working conditions may be bad at these companies but when they're regulated into conformity or go under or whatever, the progress will still be there, the technology and the evidence that these things can be done and further improved upon.

The government only cares about short term investors that have no connection to the company, only the numbers, whereas they actually need to be protecting the people that care about the company doing well."

They unionize and attempt to take over management jobs, moving people in whenever possible from the other side of the planet to have advantage in numbers. If Americans attempt to unionize they are fired.  Executives have been completely brainwashed by left wing thinking that, because we must be blind to race and national origin, H1B's are by default better.  H1B's are only better for management because they are kept as house slaves unable to change jobs and fearful of being fired/deported.

And they love the videos of teslas beating Ferraris in a quarter mile... Well, Ferraris aren't drag racers. And that's about the only way a tesla can beat a Ferrari. Maybe a mile later, the tesla will overheat and go into protect mode, limited to 25mph.Frustrating, really. Particularly when, in racing, the hybrid prototypes are legitimately and significantly faster than Lamborghinis. What I think should be done is a long-lifespan hybrid design. Put the fun computer toys into an open format computer tower type design. Use the gas or diesel engine to power a generator only, and all drive systems operate electric. That way, as long as the chasis is in good condition, the rest can be upgraded as need be. In that way, waste can be reduced. As cooling tech advances, swap battery cells. As auto pilot advances, swap computer components. When the tech completely makes internal combustion obsolete, swap the engine for an additional bank of batterys, or whatever more efficient generator, or just remove to shave weight. But whatever to streamline production waste, and give the consumer a better bang for buck, while reducing waste and pollution from needless production."

Tesla replaced the packs and worked with the companies to double the life by charging 80%-20%, even under worst case batteries were lasting 200k miles.

If there is negligence, I believe it would be on the behest of the service center which removed the part intended to prevent accelerating beyond 86mph that was removed without the ownersâ€™ permission, rather than with the battery itself. No parent should ever have to endure the death of a child, but it does look like operator-error and not negligence on the part of Tesla - the odds of surviving a high speed crash are incredibly low."

It could have been only a couple more years or decades before the next company did it, we dont know. But with Tesla we do know its happening right now and time does matter when it comes to changing a market like this for the better.Its also not a stretch at all to say self driving vehicles will save lives, thousands of lives. In the US alone there are 30,000 plus deaths per year on the road, computers are already better drivers than humans we just wont be comfortable with them until they're basically infallible. If they reduce road deaths by even 10% thats thousands of lives and thats a pretty conservative estimate. Again it would have happened eventually but the sooner the better. The Model 3 is also continually getting cheaper and like Ive said, theyre almost at 200,000+ sold so to say they havent sold that many is disingenuous. They started with the roadsters and model S which were truly for the rich and are now working their way to consumer levels. I like that progress. Second point (SpaceX); Yeah, for the time being resource acquistion is a stretch but it is inevitable which is why I mentioned it. Not just precious metals but just things like water to create fuel for deep space travel.Im not sure what you mean by controversy. SpaceX developed reusable rockets, a fairly simple concept just difficult to execute. Their cost to orbit is significantly lower than anyone else's, and only going to get lower.https://spacenews.com/spacexs-reusable-falcon-9-what-are-the-real-cost-savings-for-customers/Third (Starlink); It just started, no news that it works, no news that it doesnt.

And even if its not free, it will make access much cheaper.Ill admit, I was only speaking of myself and those I know personally about why we think he is an important figure. From that perspective its because of the reasons above. I dont know anything about his social media. I dont stay up late waiting for his press conferences. He's an influential person changing the world for the better and inspiring (or economically forcing) related markets to do the same.As for his detractors, it seems their gripes are more an adverse reaction to the admitedly bloated, constant media attention he gets, not because he's hasnt contributed anything."

Chinese people often want to be their own boss rather than work for someone else.Regarding Chinese engineers, there is a perception that East Asians, although they are perceived as technologically experts, are not qualified to be leaders in the Western business since.

Iâ€™ve got to fire somebody,â€™ â€ù one former high-Â_ranking executive told me. (A Tesla spokesperson disputed this but added that Musk makes â€œdifficult but necessary decisions.â€ù) At one meeting Musk, agitated, broke a phone. During another, he noticed that an executive was missing and called him. The manâ€™s wife had recently given birth, and he explained that he was taking time off as she recuperated. Musk was angry. At a minimum, you should be on phone calls, Musk told the man. Having a kid doesnâ€™t prevent you from being on the phone. (A Tesla spokesperson said that while Musk â€œwas once upset that a particular executive did not dial into an important conference call several days after his child was born,â€ù the company would not penalize an employee for taking paternity leave.)-----------&gt; The young Tesla engineer was excited. Ecstatic, in fact. It was a Saturday in October 2017, and he was working at the Gigafactory, Teslaâ€™s enormous battery manufacturing plant in Nevada. Over the previous year, he had been living out of a suitcase, putting in 13-hour days, seven days a week. This was his first real job. And now a colleague had tracked him down to say that Elon Muskâ€”Elon Musk!â€”needed his personal help.&gt; The previous year, Musk had made an audacious announcement: His company, which was knownâ€”fetishized, actuallyâ€”for its luxurious electric vehicles, would soon begin manufacturing a new sedan that it planned to sell for just $35,000, putting it within reach of the middle class. The Model 3, Tesla hoped, would transform the auto industry by proving that a mass-produced, emissions-free vehicle was not only feasible but profitable. If successful, the vehicle would help end humanityâ€™s addiction to fossil fuels, slow climate change, and show that ingenuity and ambition could accomplish nearly anything. Within a year of that announcement, however, work on the car was behind schedule. There were problems in battery manufacturing, parts construction, development of assembly lines. Teslaâ€™s goal was to build 5,000 vehicles a week; recently the company had been producing roughly three cars a day. Many inside the Gigafactoryâ€”not to mention at the Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto and the assembly factory in Fremont, Californiaâ€”had been working hard for months, trying to get things on track.&gt; Musk was spending the weekend in the Gigafactory, attempting to discover why machines werenâ€™t functioning, why parts kept misaligning, why the software was crashing. Musk had demanded that his factories be automated as much as possible. But among the consequences of this extreme roboticization were delays and malfunctions. Tesla had spent more than $1 billion building the Gigafactory, and almost nothing was going as planned.&gt; **At about 10 oâ€™clock on Saturday evening, an angry Musk was examining one of the production lineâ€™s mechanized modules, trying to figure out what was wrong, when the young, excited engineer was brought over to assist him.**&gt; **â€œHey, buddy, this doesnâ€™t work!â€ù Musk shouted at the engineer, according to someone who heard the conversation. â€œDid you do this?â€ù**&gt; **The engineer was taken aback. He had never met Musk before. Musk didnâ€™t even know the engineerâ€™s name. The young man wasnâ€™t certain what, exactly, Musk was asking him, or why he sounded so angry.**&gt; **â€œYou mean, program the robot?â€ù the engineer said. â€œOr design that tool?â€ù**&gt; **â€œDid you fucking do this?â€ù Musk asked him.**&gt; **â€œIâ€™m not sure what youâ€™re referring to?â€ù the engineer replied apologetically.**&gt; **â€œYouâ€™re a fucking idiot!â€ù Musk shouted back. â€œGet the fuck out and donâ€™t come back!â€ù**&gt; **The young engineer climbed over a low safety barrier and walked away. He was bewildered by what had just happened. The entire conversation had lasted less than a minute. A few moments later, his manager came over to say that he had been fired on Muskâ€™s orders, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The engineer was shocked. Heâ€™d been working so hard. He was set to get a review from his manager the next week, and had been hearing only positive things. Instead, two days later, he signed his separation papers.**"
t3_alx36k,,,,"&gt;San Francisco, United States : Elon Musk announced Thursday he had released all of the electric carmaker Tesla's patents, as part of an effort to fight climate change.In a blog post, the colorful billionaire founder of Tesla promised the company ""will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.""&gt;It was a remarkable move in an industry where the smallest idea or seed of invention is carefully guarded to protect its monetary value.&gt;""Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport,"" Musk said. ""If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.""&gt;In fact Musk said he was now skeptical of patents which too often only served ""to stifle progress"" and helped enrich giant corporations and lawyers rather than inventors.&gt;He said he had earlier felt compelled to file patents for Tesla to prevent big car companies from copying the technology and using the huge marketing and sales apparatus to take over the market.&gt;""We couldn't have been more wrong. The unfortunate reality is the opposite,"" he said, noting that electric or clean-fuel cars ""at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent.""&gt;But with car production continuing at 100 million a year ""it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis,"" Musk said."

These companies are lot like one that I previously worked for in which there is an in-group and an out-group. Sadly these groups are basically just formed dependent on individual personalities. For instance, one common personality trait would cause a person to view their job as nothing more than a means to support their family. There is nothing wrong with this trait and often these people are great workers because they have great motivations but they never work their way into the companies ""family"".This in-group/out-group thing is most common in smaller start-up companies but can persist for a long time even as the company grows. The ""in-group"" varies in type from business to business. Sadly it functions somewhat in the same that high schools often do with the ""popular"" kids and other groups, though in these companies the ""popular"" kids are often the ""nerds"" as it was in the company I worked for. It is true that those who were considered ""nerds"" in high school often excel after school."

If you don't agree, no one is ever going to force you to work there. Read any background on Musk and you can see the reasoning behind his harsh work schedule that he imposes on himself and expects of everyone that works for and/or with him. Furthermore, Tesla is enough of a niche company that outside of a small percentage who stumble into a job there today, most of us would be smart enough to read up on the company before trying to get a job there. So all my point was establishing, is that Tesla should make sure that they're getting their company attitude and expectations across clearly in the hiring process. Again, if people don't agree with how a company operates, they don't have to work there. If it's clear a company has found a way to actually create a bad workplace environment, then there's organizations, groups and media that will get laws placed before us to moderate it.

The plant that they manufacture in put out 480k vehicles when GM/Toyota owned it and that was with much older technology building what Elon Musk claims are much more complicated vehicles with IC engines. Suppliers deal with these volumes on a regular basis, yet somehow Musk blames their bottlenecks on their supply lines. They need to expand into a tent, despite only building three different low volume models with only a few different options/grades. When Ford was as old as Tesla is now, they were producing 820,000 cars per year. That was in 1919. Cars may have been simpler then, but so were production methods, and Ford was making them up as he went along. If they are having to resort to these kinds of methods in 2019 to build 300k cars, then that points to a severely mismanaged company."

But Tesla is no ordinary company, and Musk is [no ordinary man](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-tesla-life-inside-gigafactory/): &gt; Musk â€œwould say â€˜Iâ€™ve got to fire someone today,â€™ and Iâ€™d say, â€˜No you donâ€™t,â€™ and heâ€™d say, â€˜No, no, I just do. Iâ€™ve got to fire somebody,â€™ â€ù one former high-Â_ranking executive told me. (A Tesla spokesperson disputed this but added that Musk makes â€œdifficult but necessary decisions.â€ù) At one meeting Musk, agitated, broke a phone. During another, he noticed that an executive was missing and called him. The manâ€™s wife had recently given birth, and he explained that he was taking time off as she recuperated. Musk was angry. At a minimum, you should be on phone calls, Musk told the man. Having a kid doesnâ€™t prevent you from being on the phone. (A Tesla spokesperson said that while Musk â€œwas once upset that a particular executive did not dial into an important conference call several days after his child was born,â€ù the company would not penalize an employee for taking paternity leave.)-----------&gt; The young Tesla engineer was excited. Ecstatic, in fact. It was a Saturday in October 2017, and he was working at the Gigafactory, Teslaâ€™s enormous battery manufacturing plant in Nevada. Over the previous year, he had been living out of a suitcase, putting in 13-hour days, seven days a week. This was his first real job. And now a colleague had tracked him down to say that Elon Muskâ€”Elon Musk!â€”needed his personal help.&gt; The previous year, Musk had made an audacious announcement: His company, which was knownâ€”fetishized, actuallyâ€”for its luxurious electric vehicles, would soon begin manufacturing a new sedan that it planned to sell for just $35,000, putting it within reach of the middle class. The Model 3, Tesla hoped, would transform the auto industry by proving that a mass-produced, emissions-free vehicle was not only feasible but profitable. If successful, the vehicle would help end humanityâ€™s addiction to fossil fuels, slow climate change, and show that ingenuity and ambition could accomplish nearly anything. Within a year of that announcement, however, work on the car was behind schedule. There were problems in battery manufacturing, parts construction, development of assembly lines. Teslaâ€™s goal was to build 5,000 vehicles a week; recently the company had been producing roughly three cars a day. Many inside the Gigafactoryâ€”not to mention at the Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto and the assembly factory in Fremont, Californiaâ€”had been working hard for months, trying to get things on track.&gt; Musk was spending the weekend in the Gigafactory, attempting to discover why machines werenâ€™t functioning, why parts kept misaligning, why the software was crashing. Musk had demanded that his factories be automated as much as possible. But among the consequences of this extreme roboticization were delays and malfunctions. Tesla had spent more than $1 billion building the Gigafactory, and almost nothing was going as planned.&gt; **At about 10 oâ€™clock on Saturday evening, an angry Musk was examining one of the production lineâ€™s mechanized modules, trying to figure out what was wrong, when the young, excited engineer was brought over to assist him.**&gt; **â€œHey, buddy, this doesnâ€™t work!â€ù Musk shouted at the engineer, according to someone who heard the conversation. â€œDid you do this?â€ù**&gt; **The engineer was taken aback. He had never met Musk before. Musk didnâ€™t even know the engineerâ€™s name. The young man wasnâ€™t certain what, exactly, Musk was asking him, or why he sounded so angry.**&gt; **â€œYou mean, program the robot?â€ù the engineer said. â€œOr design that tool?â€ù**&gt; **â€œDid you fucking do this?â€ù Musk asked him.**&gt; **â€œIâ€™m not sure what youâ€™re referring to?â€ù the engineer replied apologetically.**&gt; **â€œYouâ€™re a fucking idiot!â€ù Musk shouted back. â€œGet the fuck out and donâ€™t come back!â€ù**&gt; **The young engineer climbed over a low safety barrier and walked away. He was bewildered by what had just happened. The entire conversation had lasted less than a minute. A few moments later, his manager came over to say that he had been fired on Muskâ€™s orders, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The engineer was shocked. Heâ€™d been working so hard. He was set to get a review from his manager the next week, and had been hearing only positive things. Instead, two days later, he signed his separation papers.**"

The Model 3 has already sold in the 6 figure range. This has implications for the environment and the safety/efficiency of mass transport as self-driving cars are introduced saving thousands of lives a year.SpaceX: Cut the cost of transferring objects and materials to space tremendously via reusable launch vehicles improving the future of communications, scientific research, weather monitoring, and possibly resource acquisition.As a footnote to SpaceX, Starlink (already in the works) will provide interent access globally to places that desparately need improved access or any access at all while also cutting latency. This is possible because of the reduced cost of moving things to orbit.Working conditions may be bad at these companies but when they're regulated into conformity or go under or whatever, the progress will still be there, the technology and the evidence that these things can be done and further improved upon.

These companies are lot like one that I previously worked for in which there is an in-group and an out-group. Sadly these groups are basically just formed dependent on individual personalities. For instance, one common personality trait would cause a person to view their job as nothing more than a means to support their family. There is nothing wrong with this trait and often these people are great workers because they have great motivations but they never work their way into the companies ""family"".This in-group/out-group thing is most common in smaller start-up companies but can persist for a long time even as the company grows. The ""in-group"" varies in type from business to business. Sadly it functions somewhat in the same that high schools often do with the ""popular"" kids and other groups, though in these companies the ""popular"" kids are often the ""nerds"" as it was in the company I worked for. It is true that those who were considered ""nerds"" in high school often excel after school."

t3_ce1cvg,,,,"To each their own, although it is funny that you compare a five passenger sedan to a truck and two different top of the line sports cars.  I like your range of possibilities.I always enjoyed v8 + supercharger noise so not going to argue there.  I do miss that roaring sound of power. Tesla is very different when it comes to sound. One of the adjustments in the Tesla is learning that people cannot hear you at all. I have had people in hoodies walk right in front of the car. Quiet can be good too, you realize all that noise was taking a toll on you. When the noise is gone, driving is less of a stress. Tesla truck is coming. Teslaâ€™s are already crossing 500k in taxis so not worried there. There were some lesson learned (early taxis were filling from zero to 100% on superchargers which is the worst you can do to the battery. Tesla replaced the packs and worked with the companies to double the life by charging 80%-20%, even under worst case batteries were lasting 200k miles. Now Model 3 batteries are trending to last 500k miles. The rumor is next yearâ€™s battery will last a million miles. Since the cars have no engine and only one reduction gear (rated for a million miles), there is just not much to go wrong. I always liked simple trucks without much to go wrong, Teslaâ€™s have one tenth the parts of a simple truck."

If you don't agree, no one is ever going to force you to work there. Read any background on Musk and you can see the reasoning behind his harsh work schedule that he imposes on himself and expects of everyone that works for and/or with him. Furthermore, Tesla is enough of a niche company that outside of a small percentage who stumble into a job there today, most of us would be smart enough to read up on the company before trying to get a job there. So all my point was establishing, is that Tesla should make sure that they're getting their company attitude and expectations across clearly in the hiring process. Again, if people don't agree with how a company operates, they don't have to work there. If it's clear a company has found a way to actually create a bad workplace environment, then there's organizations, groups and media that will get laws placed before us to moderate it.

The share price instantly ballooned and investors  either made or lost billions on the news.  Problem is, Musk's statement was entirely false.  It's not a free speech issue.  Federal law strictly dictates when and what a CEO can say about their company and this was a gross violation.  Other CEO's have served hard felony time for the same thing.  Musk just copied Trump, said the regulators were fake news and insulted the court.He should be in prison, but in some ways I almost prefer that he continue to be free to run Tesla into the ground and show how unethical and incompetent he is, so that people will eventually know the true Elon Musk."

It doesn't say that Tesla will actually use those patents, or require them to be available to them, it just says that they won't sue, as long as the ones using their patents will play nice, at least that's what they say, no idea if they'll actually follow through.It will still benefit Tesla if other companies use their patent, without the need for them to also use other companies' patents.&gt; Those moves werenâ€™t purely altruistic, and neither is Teslaâ€™s.â€œIn one sense, Tesla is clearly giving something up: the ability to keep competitors from using their proprietary tech,â€ù Also&gt; Toyota, Ford, Honda, and the rest would never knowingly infringe on Teslaâ€™s patents without legal documentation that everything is cool.â€œWeâ€™re more than happy to do some sort of simple agreement with other car manufacturers if theyâ€™re concerned about that,â€ù said Musk in a press call following yesterdayâ€™s announcement.Meaning that, they could very well sign a legally binding agreement to prevent any sort of ""back-stabs"" if they were concerned about that, which I'd say it would be smart to do anyway.So I'd say OP's comment about Tesla also using other patents was misleading."

Are there low end state colleges that are reliant on international students to make ends meet? Yes. Is Stanford? Hell no, itâ€™s fucking Stanford. There are a ton of Asian international students at Stanford because those countries are highly populated and they have a lot of talent.

If these parts were clips to hold an electrical harness to a particular part of the car, and there are other measures of securing it, where is the issue? If the issue is a harness connection clip, what is the â€œbetterâ€ù repair: removing and replacing entire harness, re-pinning a new plastic connector, or using electrical tape to secure broken connector housing together?

The Model 3 has already sold in the 6 figure range. This has implications for the environment and the safety/efficiency of mass transport as self-driving cars are introduced saving thousands of lives a year.My favorite bit is when you added â€œsaving thousands of lives a year.â€ù What do you base that off of? Youâ€™re just trying to make a car manufacturer appear like some destined savior who saves lives by...selling cars. Definitely a stretch. But on top of the fact that electric cars were on the way anyway, especially after the mass market acceptance of hybrids, Tesla never made electric cars â€œviable.â€ù It made them marketable. If they made them viable, then Tesla would be the biggest sellers on the market. But theyâ€™re not. Theyâ€™re losing money left and right, and their stocks just keep going down and down. They donâ€™t sell that many cars, and theyâ€™re cheapest model is 54k, meaning only the wealthy can take part in Teslaâ€™s â€œplan to save livesâ€ù. Saying Tesla is some sort of game changer is just really good PR&gt;SpaceX: Cut the cost of transferring objects and materials to space tremendously via reusable launch vehicles improving the future of communications, scientific research, weather monitoring, and possibly resource acquisition.I donâ€™t know much about Space X, but thereâ€™s definitely controversy here. Although resource acquisition seems more like another symptom of the hype machine than anything else&gt;As a footnote to SpaceX, Starlink (already in the works) will provide interent access globally to places that desparately need improved access or any access at all while also cutting latency. This is possible because of the reduced cost of moving things to orbit.Well on top of the problems Starlink is causing with actual research on earth, thereâ€™s no word on how well it functions. Thereâ€™s also that language again: â€œdesperately needed.â€ù Well he provide these impoverished areas with FREE internet? Doubtful&gt;Working conditions may be bad at these companies but when they're regulated into conformity or go under or whatever, the progress will still be there, the technology and the evidence that these things can be done and further improved upon. Anyone can spend the rest of the day nitpicking at the value of what these companies have accomplished but whether theyre right or wrong, the combined good achieved is invaluable to humanity. Thats why he has a following, not because of his tweets.Elon Musk doesnâ€™t really have a following because of that. Otherwise, other scientific figures would be just as popular.

t3_b44exr,,,,"Yeah the idea that google/Apple/Tesla/etc is cutting corners by not hiring Americans is just absurd.  Like... I donâ€™t doubt that some tech firms go for the people they can pay less which may be an H1B worker, but when weâ€™re talking about the top of the industry, they get the best possible talent regardless of nationality.   Itâ€™s like if they said Stanford was choosing to admit international students in order to cut costs. For Stanford, they donâ€™t need to cut costs, they just want the best students possible, which often includes people from (gasp) China, literally the worlds most populated country My only guess is that the posters upvoting this nonsense are familiar with lower end jobs that have been automated or outsourced to India or whatever and they assume every company has the same hiring structure even when those firms obviously operate in a fundamentally different environment"
t3_aurwqs,,,,Lol itâ€™s what Tesla claims is their profit margin yet theyâ€™re barely making any money and after a pathetic q4 Musk says they probably wonâ€™t be profitable in Q1 of this year while out selling every other luxury sedan on the market. That is pathetic

t3_aw27st,,,,"You just have to spend a little time educating yourself.  Look up the invoice of the vehicle, the destination fee, available rebates/incentives etc and you can easily calculate the dealerships margin and know where to base your negotiations.  I usually come up with a firm number and just call around for the sales managers or email them.  It's a few hours of work to save thousands, and I never set foot in a dealership until the deal is finalized and I'm ready to sign.  Just because Tesla won't have middle men doesn't mean you are getting the best deal, if there is no negotiating involved then I'd say most likely it's the other way around.  When someone advertises ""no haggle"" I usually run the other way."

t3_cb1woe,,,,"The sad reality is that the business industry only knows how to â€œcut costâ€ù. They are so obsessed with validating administrative payrolls that they donâ€™t even care about how it affects the working class, or care about bettering society. The sad truth is that the baby boomers are the ones to blame, and everyone is so selfish. They do less work, take more sick days, complain the most and take more paid vacations and sick days than anyone, not to mention they refuse to retire or improve anything. Itâ€™s absolutely lazy. Never mind that the biggest single handed consumption of sick leave, and vacation days come from them, or the fact that the good ole boy system still exists, but by the time they retire there wonâ€™t be an economy left to take over. They sold out for beauty products, and self preservation.

Consumer reports may have some valid points about reliability, but itâ€™s understandable that any car company that is 15 years old would still be figuring out how to Kaizen their manufacturing process to deliver the type of consistency associated with say Toyota or Hondaâ€™s level of reliability.  That being said, the driving experience of the Model 3 is amazing.  I compare it to getting youâ€™re first smart phone after using a flip phone.  You just never want to go back. So Iâ€™ll happily deal with the possibility of something small requiring repair.

Suppliers deal with these volumes on a regular basis, yet somehow Musk blames their bottlenecks on their supply lines. They need to expand into a tent, despite only building three different low volume models with only a few different options/grades. When Ford was as old as Tesla is now, they were producing 820,000 cars per year. That was in 1919.

I wonder if the fact of that fatal cliff being well known would in effect provide enough incentive for major shareholders to artificially prop up the stock to avoid it.For example, if people/organizations who had millions/billions invested in Tesla realized that if it hit $220/share, that the margin call and resulting liquidation could drop the stock down to ~$100 or more, would that incentivize them to dump more cash into the company to float it above that number to protect their own interests. OR, inversely, would it cause major shareholders to premptively dump their own holdings if it started getting closer to that number instead. For example, maybe the death spiral would start even higher, say $250, since people would want to avoid chasing bad money with good and try and get out before it hit $220, thus causing a quick collapse at an even higher value."

The agency said the tweet, which sent the electric automakerâ€™s share price up as much as 13.3%, violated securities laws. Muskâ€™s privatization plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place."
t3_baj70x,,,,"A billion years ago they did a contest between the (then new) 300ZX and a corvette of roughly the same price. The 300ZX was just a touch slower on the track but far worse as time wore on. Massive brake fade. Later they saw that they warped the rotors, I forgot how much that lap cost in repairs. Letâ€™s have the Tesla do a 300 mile race in the cold. Then we talk."
t3_ay2hrp,,,,"When is GM or Ford going to offer an electric car of a similar standard as Tesla?  Iâ€™m 110% for competition in this market, but Iâ€™m tired of gas guzzling cars.  I want an electric.  Whether I get it from Tesla or some other company just depends on the quality of the product.  I donâ€™t want some hideous misshapen toy looking electric.  I want a stylish sleek performance vehicle that Tesla has proven can be produced.   And all the Teslaâ€™s I see driving around where I live proves to me I am not alone."
t3_b4rxam,,,,Fuck it jailbreak the Tesla 
t3_aw27st,,,,Good. Car dealerships are a useless outdated model. Maybe more manufacturers will catch on. 
t3_cb1woe,,,,But...but Elon Musk is a selfless savior of humanity. All his fanbois say so.
t3_boqokq,,,,"Tesla needs a Pissed Mode where it starts shocking vandals like this like that BMW in the Bond movie.  Of course, it's Sacramento and pretty much everyone deserves to be shocked so Elon had better add an extra battery just in case.  Little darts for the overzealous meter readers would be nice too."
t3_bgw3zq,,,,"Is it just me or is this basically an straight forward admittance that even the largest auto manufacturers already know that electric cars are 100% the future... If we could just get all of them to admit it simultaneously, we could start seriously impact the financial viability of expanding or even maintaining current levels of oil production/refinement. Skew the demand curve hard enough by dramatically changing consumer expectations and the price will bottom out."
t3_boqokq,,,,'Merica' t-shirt. Of course. I'm guessing the hat's too much heat nowadays.
t3_cb1woe,,,,"About that&gt;Tesla: Brought electric cars to the mass market and proved they were viable enough for major manufacturers to follow suit. The Model 3 has already sold in the 6 figure range. This has implications for the environment and the safety/efficiency of mass transport as self-driving cars are introduced saving thousands of lives a year.My favorite bit is when you added â€œsaving thousands of lives a year.â€ù What do you base that off of? Youâ€™re just trying to make a car manufacturer appear like some destined savior who saves lives by...selling cars. Definitely a stretch. But on top of the fact that electric cars were on the way anyway, especially after the mass market acceptance of hybrids, Tesla never made electric cars â€œviable.â€ù It made them marketable. If they made them viable, then Tesla would be the biggest sellers on the market. But theyâ€™re not. Theyâ€™re losing money left and right, and their stocks just keep going down and down. They donâ€™t sell that many cars, and theyâ€™re cheapest model is 54k, meaning only the wealthy can take part in Teslaâ€™s â€œplan to save livesâ€ù. Saying Tesla is some sort of game changer is just really good PR&gt;SpaceX: Cut the cost of transferring objects and materials to space tremendously via reusable launch vehicles improving the future of communications, scientific research, weather monitoring, and possibly resource acquisition.I donâ€™t know much about Space X, but thereâ€™s definitely controversy here. Although resource acquisition seems more like another symptom of the hype machine than anything else&gt;As a footnote to SpaceX, Starlink (already in the works) will provide interent access globally to places that desparately need improved access or any access at all while also cutting latency. This is possible because of the reduced cost of moving things to orbit.Well on top of the problems Starlink is causing with actual research on earth, thereâ€™s no word on how well it functions. Thereâ€™s also that language again: â€œdesperately needed.â€ù Well he provide these impoverished areas with FREE internet? Doubtful&gt;Working conditions may be bad at these companies but when they're regulated into conformity or go under or whatever, the progress will still be there, the technology and the evidence that these things can be done and further improved upon. Anyone can spend the rest of the day nitpicking at the value of what these companies have accomplished but whether theyre right or wrong, the combined good achieved is invaluable to humanity. Thats why he has a following, not because of his tweets.Elon Musk doesnâ€™t really have a following because of that. Otherwise, other scientific figures would be just as popular. He fits a certain fantasy that appeals to certain people, mainly men.[here is a good evaluation of Elon Musk](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5gnlhmaM-dM)"
t3_cb1woe,,,,"Nevada is at an will employment state, it sucks but any employer here can fire you at anytime for whatever reason, what so ever. I understand why people are attracted to Tesla, they pay a decent starting wage and if you move up you can make good money. They bonus out and offer tons of overtime, mandatory and voluntary. If you are low skill/no education Tesla is one of the best gigs you can land. However, they fucking suck to work for. You are expected to work a shifting schedule of 3 12's, 4 off, 4 12's, 3 off minimum and it is mind numbing work. Engineers sleep on site when they can, and if you don't work OT your ass is basically gone. Most people I know there are fucking miserable despite the money."

t3_bemccq,,,,"They haven't actually said it officially but general speculation is that its a reflection of the previous round of rebates. Ontario, a province in Canada used to have the largest rebate in the world of $14,000 and there was no limit on price which led to much outcry that people buying top of the line Teslas, the p100D with ludacris mode starts at $160k in Canada were using this credit that they clearly didn't need and alternatively people would buy $60k model 3's for $55K and couldn't actually afford them adding to the debt load. Eventually the gov of Ontario tried to stop applying the credit to Teslas which led to Tesla suing them and winning which was funny to watch but probably left a bitter taste in the mouth of the Federal gov.TLDR: The previous round of rebates in one part of Canada was quite high which cause the local gov to single out Tesla which led to the gov being sued by Tesla, losing and thats probably why the new round of federal rebates doesn't include them. (all mostly speculation)"
